# Asset Analysis of Javaglonema Millenial
The Aglonema Farmers Group named Javaglonema Millennial which is located in Paten, Tridadi, Sleman, DI Yogyakarta. Javaglonema Milenial already has 83 farmer members. 

The farmer groups need plant asset data owned by each member for analysis of achieving the target number of plants. This target will be achieved to realize the Aglonema Tourism Village in 2023. Therefore, technology is needed to analyze the asset inventory data of these farmer groups.

**Types of plants favored** by members of the farmer are **Legasi Merah planted by 75 members**, followed by Suksom, Red Queen, Red Anjamani, and Dud White. While Red Cherry is only planted by 9 members. This is validated by the members because legasi merah is easy to maintain and the market is good. Meanwhile, red cherry is the most sensitive type of aglonema and is difficult to treat, so it is vulnerable to death. This can be considered in determining the selling price when the plants begin to be marketed.
